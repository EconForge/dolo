## Basic installation

Dolo can be installed in several ways:

- with anaconda (recommended):

  `conda install -c conda-forge dolo`

- with pip

  `pip install dolo`


## Developper's installation

Dolo uses `poetry` as package manager, so you probably need to install poetry before you start developing the package.
